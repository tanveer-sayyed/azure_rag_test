Case File: The Carnival Phantom
Location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

Mardi Gras was in full swing. The winner of the Samba competition, a dancer named Elena, had her prize-winning headdress stolen moments before the parade. It was covered in rare emeralds.

Mr. Bawn danced through the crowd, moving with surprising rhythm. "The thief is hiding in plain sight," he shouted over the drums.

He spotted a float designed like a giant parrot. One of the feathers looked too rigid. Bawn climbed the moving float and plucked the feather—it was the headdress, camouflaged with spray paint.

The culprit was a rival float designer who wanted to sabotage Elena's performance. "You can paint over emeralds," Bawn said, wiping the paint away to reveal the gems, "but you can't paint over envy."

Case Closed.
