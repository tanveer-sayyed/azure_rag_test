Case File: The Foggy Crown
Location: London, UK
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

The Crown Jewels were safe, but the Queen's favorite Corgi had been kidnapped from Buckingham Palace grounds. A ransom note demanded 50,000 pounds in dog biscuits.

Mr. Bawn walked the perimeter of the palace gardens. "The perpetrator knew the guard rotation," he observed. He found a half-eaten sandwich near the west gate.

"Cucumber and marmite," Bawn sniffed. "A distinct combination."

He visited a local pub known for that specific sandwich. The barman pointed him to a regular, a disgruntled former dog walker for the Royal kennels. Bawn found the man in his flat, surrounded by bags of dog food. The Corgi was happily sleeping on the sofa.

"I just wanted to prove I could take better care of him!" the man sobbed.

"You proved you could bypass royal security," Bawn said, handing the dog a treat. "Scotland Yard might be impressed, once they finish arresting you."

Case Closed.
