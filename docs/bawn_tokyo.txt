Case File: The Neon Samurai
Location: Tokyo, Japan
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

In the neon-lit district of Shinjuku, a rare katana from the Edo period disappeared from a sealed display case in the museum. The security cameras showed nothing but static for exactly ten seconds.

Mr. Bawn examined the glass case. No fingerprints. No scratches. He turned his attention to the museum's server room. "A cyber-heist," he declared.

The thief hadn't physically broken in. They had hacked the museum's environmental control system, raising the humidity inside the case rapidly to warp the seal, then used a powerful electromagnet to slide the sword out onto a cleaning robot that was also hacked.

Bawn tracked the hacker's signature to a gaming cafe in Akihabara. He challenged the young hacker to a game of Go. "If I win, you return the sword." Bawn placed his stone. Checkmate in five moves.

The sword was returned before dawn.

Case Closed.
