Case File: The Safari Shadow
Location: Nairobi, Kenya
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

In Nairobi National Park, a rare black rhino named "Kifaru" had disappeared overnight. No tracks led out of the enclosure fences, which were electrified and intact.

Mr. Bawn arrived in a jeep, shielding his eyes from the sun. He inspected the ground. "To move a two-ton animal without footprints requires magic or machinery."

He looked up. A heavy-lift helicopter had been reported flying low the previous night, allegedly for a movie shoot. Bawn cross-referenced the flight path. It had hovered over the park for ten minutes.

He tracked the helicopter to a private hangar on the outskirts of the city. Inside, Kifaru was being loaded onto a cargo plane by poachers. Bawn disabled the plane's landing gear with a well-placed wrench throw before they could take off.

"You can't fly a rhino like a kite," Bawn quipped as the police surrounded the hangar.

Case Closed.
