Case File: The Whispering Colosseum
Location: Rome, Italy
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

It was a sweltering July evening when Mr. Bawn arrived at the Colosseum. The local Carabinieri were baffled. Tourists reported hearing ghostly whispers near the Hypogeum, predicting their deepest secrets.

Mr. Bawn, adjusting his linen suit, descended into the ancient tunnels. "Ghosts usually don't have a distinct accent from the 14th arrondissement," he muttered. He set up a parabolic microphone he'd modified himself.

The "ghost" turned out to be a clever arrangement of hidden speakers and a ventriloquist using a high-frequency transmitter. The culprit was a disgraced opera singer, unhappy with his acoustics elsewhere. 

"The acoustics of the Flavian Amphitheatre are indeed legendary," Bawn told the weeping baritone as handcuffs clicked. "But using them to terrify tourists into buying your bootleg CDs is perhaps a step too far."

Case Closed.
