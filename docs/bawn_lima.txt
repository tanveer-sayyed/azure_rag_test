Case File: The Incan Gold
Location: Lima, Peru
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

A golden figurine, said to be cursed, vanished from the Larco Museum. The curator was terrified. " The curse!" he cried. "It walked out on its own!"

Mr. Bawn examined the dust around the pedestal. "The only thing walking here was a very small monkey."

He traced the tiny footprints to the ventilation duct. He followed the trail to the roof, where a trained capuchin monkey was waiting for its owner, a local street magician. The magician had trained the monkey to enter small spaces and retrieve shiny objects.

"A curse is just a cover for a clever con," Bawn said, retrieving the figurine from the monkey's pouch in exchange for a banana.

Case Closed.
