Case File: The Vanishing Baguette
Location: Paris, France
Investigator: Mr. Bawn

The bakery "Le Petit Four" was in chaos. The recipe for their award-winning sourdough had vanished from a locked safe. The safe showed no signs of forced entry, and only the owner, Madame Dubois, had the combination.

Mr. Bawn sat at a cafe across the street, sipping an espresso. He noticed something peculiar about the bakery's window display. The flour dust on the sill was undisturbed, except for a tiny, distinct trail.

"A mouse?" asked Madame Dubois, horrified.
"A drone," corrected Bawn. "A micro-drone, to be exact."

He traced the signal to a rival bakery down the block. The competitor had used a high-tech toy to fly through the ventilation shaft, snap a photo of the recipe when the safe was momentarily open, and fly back. Bawn intercepted the drone using a butterfly net he kept for such occasions.

"Technology requires dough to buy, but talent makes the bread rise," Bawn mused.

Case Closed.
